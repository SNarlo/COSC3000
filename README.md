# COSC3000


DataVis Project - This project gave students the ability to analyse any topic they wanted and to visualise their findings. I chose to examine which football league was the best during 2008 and 2016. I used Python and various data science libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn to complete this project. Final grade for this project was 7/7.

mega_racer - This project was the set project for COSC3000's grpahics module; the project entailed rendering, shading and texturing a racer game. This project was completed using PyOpenGL. Final grade for this project was 6/7.
